## Employees
On the new employees page, you can create
new RMS accounts that can then log into the system
to manage the products or orders. You can also remove
these accounts, or change them.

These accounts also contain contact information of the user,
so you can easily look up the contact information of an employee.

## Products

On the new product page, you can see what products you are selling
in your web shop, add new products, delete products, and edit products.

All products have images, a name, a description, and also a base price.
